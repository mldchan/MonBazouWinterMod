## 1. Pull Requests

You can fork the repository, make changes and open a pull request to contribute.

Here are some styling rules I would love y'all to follow.

1. **Clean code**: 
    - Do not use excessively long lines. You can split up any long line to multiple lines.
    - Do not nest too many `if` statements inside of each other. You can invert `if` statements instead.
    - The performance of the code shouldn't be devastating. Try to maintain good performance of code, and avoid using `Update`.
2. **Clear descriptions**:
    - Commit messages should be clean, and not keysmashing or similar.
3. **Legal**:
    - You should follow all licenses, like the CC0 license that goes on the textures inside this project, and the GNU GPLv3 license which goes on any of the code in this mod.
    - Violating these licenses could get you in legal trouble. You should study at least the most basic information of these licenses.

## 2. Downloads

You can download the mod from NexusMods instead of GitHub/GitLab/Codeberg! This will give me a bit of money per download, but please don't abuse this and don't create alt accounts.

## 3. Donations

I accept donations. A list of methods to donate are listed [here](https://mldchan.dev/donate).
